# 1. Purpose and Effect of Code Review

## 1.1 Purpose of Code Review

Code review is the process of having a third party inspect source code to improve quality. The main objectives are:

- **Early detection of bugs**
- **Enhancement of code readability and maintainability**
- **Validation of design correctness**
- **Improvement of team-wide technical skills (knowledge sharing)**
- **Reduction of security risks**

## 1.2 Effects of Code Review

- **Quality Improvement**: Early detection and correction of bugs and design flaws
- **Prevention of Individual Dependency**: Enables multiple team members to understand the code
- **Ensuring Consistency**: Standardization of coding styles and design philosophies across the project
- **Learning Effect**: Provides learning opportunities for junior engineers

## 1.3 Contribution to KAIZEN (Continuous Improvement) in Agile Development

- **Strengthened Feedback Loops**: Sharing good and bad aspects of code in short cycles to improve subsequent development
- **Knowledge Accumulation within the Team**: Sharing and standardizing good design and implementation patterns
- **Continuous Reduction of Technical Debt**: Cultivating the habit of pointing out and fixing improvements as they are found
- **Fostering Refactoring Culture**: Embedding a mindset of continuous improvement into the development cycle
