# 5. Role Distribution between CI/CD and Local Execution

## Reason for Role Separation

- Running all validations on CI/CD increases execution time and degrades speed
- Developers can improve efficiency by running checks locally when possible
- Tasks like formatting and linting should integrate into IDEs or plugins

## âœ… Recommended CI/CD (gitlab-ci) Tasks

| Task                          | Tool                   | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Static Analysis (Design/Type) | PHPStan (Larastan)     | Detect design issues and type errors early |
| Static Analysis (Security)    | Psalm / Composer Audit | Automatically detect vulnerabilities       |
| Unit Testing / Coverage       | PHPUnit                | Ensure test coverage and maintain quality  |

## âœ… Local Execution Tasks (Developer)
