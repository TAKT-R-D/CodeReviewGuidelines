# Comprehensive Code Review Operation Guidelines â€” A Practical Guide Covering Quality, Productivity, and AI Utilization

(2025/03/26 @kurab)

## Summary

This guideline systematically outlines the purpose, perspectives, role distribution, operation flow, and AI utilization (Model Context Protocol - MCP) of code review in software development. In addition to traditional code review for quality assurance, it promotes the effective use of AI and static analysis tools to balance development speed and quality. The guide also addresses handling legacy code, role separation between CI/CD and developers, and the future review model using MCP.
