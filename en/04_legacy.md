# 4. Considerations and Practical Operations for Legacy Code

## 4.1 Recognize the Gap between Ideal and Reality

- Maintaining all code ideally is difficult
- Prioritize "status quo" or "limited-scope improvements" around legacy code

## 4.2 Focus on New or Modified Code

- Limit review to newly added or modified code
- Register legacy problems as technical debt for separate refactoring

## 4.3 Emphasize Impact Range Identification and Verification

- Legacy code can have tight coupling risks
- Cover changes with unit tests and integration tests as much as possible

## 4.4 Prioritize Continuous Improvement over Perfection

- Do not aim for perfection in one review, prioritize continuous improvement
- Share consensus on trade-offs and improvement points within the team
